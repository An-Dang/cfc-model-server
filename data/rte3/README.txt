* A SEARCH TASK DATASET FOR GERMAN TEXTUAL ENTAILMENT *
*******************************************************

This is a Textual Entailment (TE) dataset from German social media data. 
It consists of a set of RTE3-alike Text/Hypothesis pairs compiled from 
a German self-help web forum for computer problems. Each Text corresponds 
to the first post in a thread, usually describing a problem to be 
diagnosed. The corresponding Hypotheses have been created with a sequence 
of crowd-sourcing tasks. The dataset contains 3014 T/H pairs in total and 
is split into a development and a test set with equal amounts of pairs.
Both sets contain 86 positive and 1421 negative entailment pairs,
respectively.
